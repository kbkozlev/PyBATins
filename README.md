This script will take in your Python scripts and the requirements file and turn them into a self-contained BAT file that can be shared.
The output BAT file will check for Python and install it if its missing, after that it will re-create the original Python and Requirements files along with a starter and optional timer file. 
The purpose of this script is to bypass EXE and other corporate blocks. 
Optionally the output can be in TXT so that sharing of BAT files can be avoided.
